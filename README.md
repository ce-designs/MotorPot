MotorPot
========
This library is written for controlling one or two motorized potentiometers,
using a L293NE or SN754410 quadruple high-current half-H driver.

If a dual channel potentiometer is used then one of the channels can be used 
to read the current value of the potentiometer. 
Please visit the next URL for more information on how to wire the 
potentiometer to the Arduino for reading the potentiometer's value:
http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ReadAnalogVoltage

If a second motorized potentiometer needs to be controller with this
library then the "DUAL_MOTOR_CONTROL" definition needs to be uncommented.

Lots of detailed tutorials can be found online, so please search the internet for some detailed description on how to wire the arduino to the H-bride and potentiometer.
